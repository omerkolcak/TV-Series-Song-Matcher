# TV Series and Song Matcher: Project Overview
I love watching tv series, and I give extra attention the song choices for the tv series I watch. Also, I love listening music, and sometimes I think that for a particular song could be a perfect for for particular TV Series. Therefore, I wonder if Machine Learning can decide that. In order to achieve this, I followed the steps:</br>
* Scraped all of the songs that is played on the TV Series from tunefind.com by using Selenium.
* I extracted the audio features of the songs from Spotify Developer API.
* I tried different classification algorithms to get the best performance. (Since this is a classification task) 
* Lastly, I productionarize the project with the Flask web framework and built some simple UI.
